# My Cook Book

This is a my first web project.

The project contains working with plain css and java script,
working with firebase authentication, firestore and firebase storage.

This project was created for learning purposes therfore involves different
methods/technics for different parts of the website and currently does not
follow a uniform design.

Future plans involves using a framework (react/angular), and adding tests.

Future feature plans can be found on docs/project-tracking.md
