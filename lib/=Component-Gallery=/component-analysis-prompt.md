# Component Gallery Entry Generator

I have a component I'd like to add to the component gallery. I'll provide you with:
1. The component's source code files (JS, CSS, HTML)
2. Example usage if available

Please:
1. Analyze the component
2. Extract all relevant information (attributes, events, methods, customizable properties)
3. Create the necessary files for the component gallery:
   - [component]-demo.html
   - [component]-demo.js
   - Update the navigation structure in gallery.js

When analyzing, please focus on:
- Public interfaces (attributes, methods, events)
- Common usage patterns
- Customizable properties
- Interactive features that should be demonstrated

After your analysis, please:
1. Confirm the extracted information
2. Ask for clarification if needed
3. Proceed with file creation step by step, getting approval at each stage
