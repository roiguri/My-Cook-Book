## Formatting rules:

- lines are 80 characters wide (exceptions: URL, gradient syntax)
- Begin every new major section of a CSS project with a title:
    /*------------------------------------*\
    #SECTION-TITLE
    \*------------------------------------*/
    - leave five blank lines between different sections on the same css file.
    - start the section title with # for easier searching
    - use kebab case for all section titles
    - use regular comment for subtitles: /* sub-title */
- syntax:
    - use kebab case for titles
- layout:
    - related selectors on the same line; unrelated selectors on new lines;
    - a space before our opening brace ({);
    - properties and values on the same line;
    - a space after our propertyâ€“value delimiting colon (:);
    - each declaration on its own new line;
    - the opening brace ({) on the same line as our last selector;
    - our first declaration on a new line after our opening brace ({);
    - our closing brace (}) on its own new line;
    - a trailing semi-colon (;) on our last declaration.
- identation:
    - each declaration indented by 2 spaces;
    - ident selectors based on their reltaions - mimicking the DOM
    - One (1) empty line between closely related rulesets.
    - Two (2) empty lines between loosely related rulesets.
