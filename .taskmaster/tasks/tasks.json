        "details": "1. **Analyze Current CLS Issues**: Use browser DevTools and Lighthouse to identify specific elements causing layout shifts, focusing on recipe cards, images, and dynamic content loading. 2. **Implement Image Optimization**: Add explicit width/height attributes to all images, implement responsive image sizing with aspect-ratio CSS, and use placeholder elements for lazy-loaded content in recipe cards and galleries. 3. **Optimize Font Loading**: Implement font-display: swap for custom fonts, preload critical fonts in the HTML head, and use font-size-adjust to minimize layout shifts during font loading. 4. **Pre-allocate Dynamic Content**: Reserve space for dynamically loaded content like recipe cards, search results, and pagination components by using skeleton screens or fixed-height containers. 5. **Optimize Component Mounting**: Ensure Web Components in Shadow DOM don't cause layout shifts during initialization by pre-defining container dimensions and using CSS transforms instead of changing layout properties. 6. **Implement Proper Loading States**: Add consistent loading placeholders that match final content dimensions for all async operations including Firebase data fetching and image loading.",
        "testStrategy": "1. **CLS Measurement**: Use Lighthouse CI to measure CLS scores before and after optimizations, aiming for a score below 0.1. Run tests on multiple page types including home, categories, and individual recipe pages. 2. **Visual Regression Testing**: Capture screenshots during page load to verify no unexpected layout shifts occur during content loading phases. 3. **Performance Testing**: Test on slow network connections (3G simulation) to ensure optimizations work under real-world conditions. 4. **Component Testing**: Verify that each Web Component loads without causing layout shifts by testing Shadow DOM mounting and content initialization. 5. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Test CLS improvements across different browsers and device sizes to ensure consistent performance gains.",
