        "description": "Refactor the categories page to improve component architecture, code organization, and maintainability following the project's Web Components pattern with Shadow DOM.",
        "details": "1. **Analyze Current Categories Page Structure**: Review existing categories page implementation in `src/app/pages/` to understand current architecture and identify refactoring opportunities. 2. **Extract Reusable Components**: Break down the categories page into smaller, reusable Web Components following the Separated Component Architecture Pattern with individual files for logic (.js), templates (.html), styles (-styles.js), and configuration (-config.js). 3. **Implement Shadow DOM Components**: Convert category-related UI elements into Custom Elements with Shadow DOM, ensuring proper encapsulation and following the pattern established in `src/lib/recipes/recipe-card/`. 4. **Service Layer Integration**: Ensure all Firebase operations go through the service layer (`src/js/services/`) rather than direct Firebase SDK calls. 5. **Update Styling Architecture**: Refactor CSS to follow the SPA styling convention with `.spa-content` scoping and organize styles in component-specific files. 6. **Component Library Organization**: Place new components in appropriate domain folders within `src/lib/` (e.g., `src/lib/categories/`). 7. **State Management**: Implement proper state management through the service layer for category data and user interactions.",
        "testStrategy": "1. **Component Isolation Testing**: Test each extracted component independently to ensure proper Shadow DOM encapsulation and functionality. 2. **Integration Testing**: Verify that refactored components integrate correctly with the categories page and maintain existing functionality. 3. **Service Layer Testing**: Confirm all Firebase operations work correctly through the service layer abstraction. 4. **Visual Regression Testing**: Compare the refactored categories page visually with the original to ensure no UI/UX regressions. 5. **Performance Testing**: Measure page load times and component rendering performance before and after refactoring. 6. **Cross-browser Testing**: Test the refactored Shadow DOM components across different browsers for compatibility. 7. **User Flow Testing**: Test complete user workflows involving category navigation, filtering, and selection to ensure seamless functionality.",

        "description": "Optimize the application to reduce Cumulative Layout Shift by implementing proper image sizing, font loading strategies, and element pre-allocation to improve Core Web Vitals.",
        "details": "1. **Analyze Current CLS Issues**: Use browser DevTools and Lighthouse to identify specific elements causing layout shifts, focusing on recipe cards, images, and dynamic content loading. 2. **Implement Image Optimization**: Add explicit width/height attributes to all images, implement responsive image sizing with aspect-ratio CSS, and use placeholder elements for lazy-loaded content in recipe cards and galleries. 3. **Optimize Font Loading**: Implement font-display: swap for custom fonts, preload critical fonts in the HTML head, and use font-size-adjust to minimize layout shifts during font loading. 4. **Pre-allocate Dynamic Content**: Reserve space for dynamically loaded content like recipe cards, search results, and pagination components by using skeleton screens or fixed-height containers. 5. **Optimize Component Mounting**: Ensure Web Components in Shadow DOM don't cause layout shifts during initialization by pre-defining container dimensions and using CSS transforms instead of changing layout properties. 6. **Implement Proper Loading States**: Add consistent loading placeholders that match final content dimensions for all async operations including Firebase data fetching and image loading.",
        "testStrategy": "1. **CLS Measurement**: Use Lighthouse CI to measure CLS scores before and after optimizations, aiming for a score below 0.1. Run tests on multiple page types including home, categories, and individual recipe pages. 2. **Visual Regression Testing**: Capture screenshots during page load to verify no unexpected layout shifts occur during content loading phases. 3. **Performance Testing**: Test on slow network connections (3G simulation) to ensure optimizations work under real-world conditions. 4. **Component Testing**: Verify that each Web Component loads without causing layout shifts by testing Shadow DOM mounting and content initialization. 5. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Test CLS improvements across different browsers and device sizes to ensure consistent performance gains.",
